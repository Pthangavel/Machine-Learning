Agile Bootcamp
Overview of agile methodology
Each and every aspects of agile methodology
Agile backlog story grooming session
Detailed discussion on each and every story and issues
Assiging the issues of each story to work on

Feb7th
Continued sesssion on backlog story grooming
PI Planning for that current sprint 
Working on the assigned issue to plan the tasks
Automated Challenger model issue
Designing list of Machine learning model to build

Feb8th
Decided on the in-scope and out-of-scope items
Discussion with Data scientist to understand the user story
Understadning the issues and tasks based on the user story
Prioratizing the tasks for the user story with Data scientist
Splitting the tasks between the data scientist and myself
Working on the tasks by creating a detail understanding document of the task

Feb 11th
Data cleaning and categorizing the data as data frame
Feature engineering of the dataset as training dataset and test dataset
Using numpy and pandas to identify the variation of the data
Working on the data to remove the noises in the data

Feb 12th
Worked on automated machine learning alogorithm - Deep learning
Deep learning - TPOT model implementation on the current dataset
Used the TPOT algorithm to work on identifyng the best algorithm
Produced best Machine learning algorithm has been used to work on the dataset

Feb 13th
Worked on to list the machine learning algorithm that it worked on before it finds the best algorithm
Worked to produce the selective machine learning algorithm using TPOT
Analysing that everytime does it produces the same algorithm in TPOT
Working on other automated machine learning model which reproduces the same result

Feb 14th
Worked on the machine learning model to dynamically / manual selection of variable trends
Worked on the reporting whether we can use the deep learning allgorthm for model validation
Challenger models list was to add one of the deep learning model
Decided to use binary classification model as challenger model for all binary targets

Feb 15th
Binary classification algorithm has been used to classify the data
Binary target has been decided to work on the data
Challenger model to validate any other binary classification machine learning model
Worked with the variable selection on the automated machine learning algorithm

Feb 18th
Challenger model to generate scoring metrics to compare the scores of each machine learning model
F1score, fittime, auc roc, recall are all listed for each machine learning model
mean score has been taken for logistic regression, adaboosting, ensemble, svm, random forest.
Created box plot based on each scores and mean values is also represented as yellow line in the middle

Feb 19th
Show case of the sprint planned with the issues solved
Created a scoring metrics using the scikit learn 
Researched on the automatic machine learning algorithm 
Worked in the TPOT machine learning to understand its capabilty

Feb 20th
Next agile sprint planning for further issues
Added issues on machine learning model ongoing monitoring
Pusing the existing implementation to master in  GitLab

Feb 21st
List of 5 machine learning models with model metrics
Receiver operating characteristic for all the 5 machine learning model
Lift chart for all the 5 machine learning model

Feb 22nd
Worked on the ROC Curve to smothen the curve
Added some hyper parameters in the machine learning model to smoothen the curve
Identified the difference in the each ROC curve to compare the machine learning model

Feb 25th
Mean score of the ROC has been corrected to bring the realistic score
Lift and Gain chart also added to know the performance of the machine learning model
Undersood the predicted probability to tweek the dataset a little to bring some difference

Feb 26th
Review of the created python notebook with statistician to know the outcome
Outcome analysis has been corrected based on the statistician review
Request for combined ROC chart from statistician

Feb 27th
Combined ROC chart for 5 machine learning model has been created for trained dataset
Combined ROC chart for test dataset has been created
